Title: Project 2 — Applied regression experiments

Tasks:
- Train on realistic datasets (California Housing, Diabetes)
- Compare feature engineering strategies (polynomial, interactions)
- Test regularization strength
- Evaluate MSE and R²; calibration of residuals

Deliverable:
- Notebook with experiments, reproducible train/test splits, plots and a short conclusions section

Acceptance:
- Show improved test MSE vs baseline
- Document when polynomial features help vs overfitting
