Title: Project 1 — Linear regression from scratch

Tasks:
- Derive and implement OLS normal equation and batch gradient descent
- Implement polynomial features
- Add L2 regularization (ridge) from theory
- Plot learning curves

Deliverable:
- Notebook + Python module with functions fit(), predict()
- Short report interpreting coefficients

Acceptance:
- Code reproduces sklearn LinearRegression/Ridge results (within numerical tolerance)
- Learning curves show expected bias/variance trends
