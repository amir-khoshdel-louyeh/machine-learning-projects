Title: Project 1 — Scaling experiments

Tasks:
- Compare StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler on models sensitive to scaling (KNN, SVM, gradient-based)
- Test pipeline behavior and leakage prevention

Deliverable:
- Notebook with performance table and guidelines

Acceptance:
- Show different scalers affect convergence/performance and document recommended defaults
