Title: Project 1 — Logistic regression (from scratch + sklearn)

Tasks:
- Derive logistic loss
- Implement binary logistic regression (Newton and SGD)
- Extend to softmax for multiclass
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC

Deliverable:
- Notebook comparing implementations and metrics across datasets (Iris, synthetic, a tabular binary dataset)

Acceptance:
- Custom implementation matches sklearn results and ROC curves are produced
