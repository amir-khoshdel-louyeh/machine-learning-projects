Title: Capstone — Real-world dataset end-to-end

Tasks:
- Pick a mid-sized dataset (e.g., UCI Adult, Kaggle House Prices, California Housing)
- Perform EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, baseline models, advanced models, ensembling, calibration, interpretability
- Short report and presentation
- Add unit tests and a reproducible run script

Deliverable:
- Fully-documented notebook, scripts for train/eval, README, short slide deck with results

Acceptance:
- Meet a target metric (e.g., >X R² / desired AUC) or beat baseline benchmark
- Reproducible pipeline; clear documented decisions and error analysis

Suggested datasets & resources:
- Built-in sklearn: Iris, digits, California Housing, diabetes, breast_cancer
- UCI & Kaggle: Adult, Wine, Titanic, House Prices, MNIST / Fashion-MNIST
- Synthetic datasets: sklearn.make_regression / make_classification / blobs
- Tools: Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib/plotly, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), joblib, seaborn
