Title: Project 1 — Optimization & regularization study

Tasks:
- Implement gradient descent (batch and SGD) for linear/logistic loss
- Study learning rates and convergence
- Implement L1/L2/ElasticNet and compare

Deliverable:
- Interactive notebook (learning rate sweep), convergence plots

Acceptance:
- Show expected convergence behavior and sparsity effect of L1
