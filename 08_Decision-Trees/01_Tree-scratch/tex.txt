Title: Project 1 — Decision tree (from-scratch CART/ID3)

Tasks:
- Implement splitting criterion (gini/entropy/MSE)
- Implement tree building with depth/pruning
- Visualize tree structure

Deliverable:
- Small tree implementation to run on toy datasets
- Notebook comparing depth/pruning effects

Acceptance:
- Performance comparable to sklearn DecisionTree on small datasets and correct splitting logic
