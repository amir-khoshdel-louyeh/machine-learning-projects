Title: Project 1 — Empirical LLN & CLT experiments

Tasks:
- Write simulations demonstrating LLN and CLT (convergence plots, distribution of sample mean)
- Bootstrap resampling

Deliverable:
- Notebook with visual proof-of-concept experiments

Acceptance:
- Clear plots showing convergence and sampling distributions
